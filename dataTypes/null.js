/**
 * The null value is quite specific. The value itself is primitive, while the type to which it belongs is not a primitive type,
 * such as Number or undefined. This is a separate category, associated with complex types, such as objects.
 *
 * The null value is used to indicate that the variable does not contain anything,
 * and most often it is a variable that is intended to contain values of complex types.
 *
 * In a nutshell, we can assume that the undefined value is assigned to uninitialized variables automatically,
 * but if we want to explicitly indicate that the variable does not contain anything, we assign it a null value.
 *
 * One important caveat for null is that when checked with the typeof operator, it will return "object", a surprising result.
 * This is a part of a much more complicated object system, but for now, you just need to know that typeof null is equal to "object".

/**
 * In this course, however, apart from minor mentions, we will not be learning a concept known as object-oriented programming,
 * and therefore, using the null value will not be so important to us for the time being.
