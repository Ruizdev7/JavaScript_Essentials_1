/**
The BigInt type is not used too often. 
It allows us to write integers of virtually any length. For almost any normal numerical operations, 
the Number type is enough, but from time to time we need a type that can handle much bigger integers.

We can use mathematical operations on BigInts in the same way as on Numbers, but there is a difference 
when dividing. As the BigInt is an integer type, the division result will always be rounded down 
to the nearest whole number.

BigInt literals are numbers with the ...n suffix.
